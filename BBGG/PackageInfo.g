  "The <span class='pkgname'>BBGG</span> package provides\
 a GAP package to implement the Bernstein, Gelfand and Gelfand correspondence,\
 in order to give several models for the derived category of coherent sheaves,\
 over the projective space. First as a triangulated stable category over left modules over\
 exterior algebras and the secondly by constructing the Beilinson monads.",
